# PyProjects
A few projects written in Python that I worked on in my free time. The ideas are not original, but the code is.

Dictionary.rtf is Norvig's dictionary (which to me seems like a list of non-words but it was the file suggested in the project description on practicepython.com).
So that isn't my work but the Hangman code is. 

Mastermind and Cows and Bulls are very similar (pretty much the same).
Cows and Bulls was another exercise I found online. Mastermind came about because I used to play it with my mom but we lost all the pieces so I decided to write code for her to play, not realizing that Cows and Bulls would've done the trick.
